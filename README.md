# Data Science Lifecycle Base Repo

Use this repo as a template repository for data science projects using the Data Science Life Cycle Process. This repo is meant to serve as a launch off point. Our goal is to introduce only **minimum viable opinions** into the structure of this repo in order to make this repository/framework useful across a variety of data science projects and workflows. Therefore, we will tend to err to the side of omitting something if we're not confident that it's widely useful or think it's overly opinionated. That shouldn't stop you from forking this repo and adapting it to fit the needs of your project/team/organization.

With that in mind, if there is something that you think we're missing or should change, open an issue and we'll talk!
